🌱 AI-Powered Agricultural Decision Support System  

📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-driven decision support system** that helps farmers adopt **sustainable agriculture practices**.  
It predicts the **most suitable crop** based on soil and environmental parameters and extends towards **resource optimization** (water & fertilizer usage) to maximize yield sustainably.  

Developed on **Google Colab**, this project leverages **machine learning** to bridge the gap between raw agricultural data and actionable insights.  

✨ Features  
🔍 **Crop Recommendation** – Predicts the best crop to grow based on soil nutrients and weather conditions.  
💧 **Resource Optimization (Future Scope)** – Suggests optimal water & fertilizer inputs for sustainable yield.  
📈 **Yield Gain Estimation (Future Scope)** – Estimates relative yield improvement (%) if recommended inputs are followed.  
🌍 **Sustainability Focus** – Encourages responsible use of resources by balancing productivity and environmental care.  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
**Language:** Python  
**Environment:** Google Colab  
**Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Model:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression (tested and compared)  

🚀 How It Works  
1. Input soil and weather parameters.  
2. ML model predicts the most suitable crop.  
3. *(Planned)* Suggests water & fertilizer usage (e.g., `120:60:40 NPK + 450 mm irrigation`).  
4. *(Planned)* Estimates yield improvement compared to baseline practices.
