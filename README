🌱 AI-Powered Agricultural Decision Support System
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-driven decision support system designed to help farmers adopt sustainable agriculture practices.
It predicts the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental parameters, and extends towards resource optimization (water & fertilizer usage) to maximize yield sustainably.

Developed on Google Colab, this project leverages machine learning to bridge the gap between data and actionable agricultural insights.

✨ Features

🔍 Crop Recommendation – Predicts the best crop to grow based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall.

💧 Resource Optimization (Planned Extension) – Suggests optimal water & fertilizer inputs for sustainable yield.

📈 Yield Gain Estimation (Planned Extension) – Estimates relative yield improvement (%) if recommended inputs are followed.

🌍 Sustainability Focus – Encourages responsible use of natural resources by balancing productivity and environmental impact.
